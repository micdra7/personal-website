            <p>
                I am an aspiring fullstack developer with particular love towards C# (.NET Core) and Javascript (React).
                Since I am constantly trying to improve and expand my skillset, I am open to any other tech stack.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently studying at Silesian University of Technology, 
                faculty of Automatic Control, Electronics and Computer Science.
            </p>
